## Introduction

The Titanic Dataset is a classic in the world of data science and machine learning. In this repository , we leverage data analysis and machine learning techniques to predict which passengers abroad the Titanic survived and which did not. Our goal is to explore the factors that influenced survival rates, such as age, gender, class, and more.

### Key Features 

â€¢ðŸ“Š Data Exploration: Dive into the Titanic dataset and gain insights into the demographics of passengers.

â€¢ðŸ¤– Machine Learning Models: Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict passenger survival based on various features.

â€¢ðŸ“ˆ Visualization: Create informative visualizations to better understand the factors that determined survival on the Titanic.
